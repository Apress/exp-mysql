# Sample test to test the SELECT DBXP execution
#

# Test 1: 
SELECT DBXP first_name, last_name, sex, id FROM staff;

# Test 2: 
SELECT DBXP id FROM staff;

# Test 3: 
SELECT DBXP dir_name FROM directorate;

# Test 4: 
SELECT DBXP id, dir_name FROM staff 
JOIN directorate ON staff.mgr_id = directorate.dir_head_id;

# Test 5: 
SELECT DBXP * FROM staff WHERE staff.id = '123456789';

# Test 6: 
SELECT DBXP first_name, last_name FROM staff JOIN directorate 
WHERE staff.mgr_id = directorate.dir_head_id and directorate.dir_code = 'N41';

# Test 7: 
SELECT DBXP * FROM directorate JOIN building ON directorate.dir_code = building.dir_code;

# Test 8: 
SELECT DBXP directorate.dir_code, dir_name, building, dir_head_id 
FROM directorate JOIN building ON directorate.dir_code = building.dir_code;
